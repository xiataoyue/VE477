\begin{problem}{\pbname}
	Given two integers $a$ and $b$, find out the greatest common divisor $d$, and the Bezout's identity $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = d$.
\end{problem}


\subsection*{Description}
GCD is the abbreviation of the greatest common divisor, which is important in cryptography because it can decide whether two integers are coprime or not. Assume that $a > b$, the trivial way to calculate the GCD is to use a loop, and perform a modular calculation at each step from 1 to $b$ to find it. However, when the integer is very large, the running time of this method can be very low, since it has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(b)$. Therefore, the Euclidean algorithm is designed to solve GCD in a faster way, which has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(\min(a, b)))$. Also assume that $a>b$, first calculate $r = a\mod b$, then repeat the process for $b$ and $r$ and so on, until the remainder reaches 0, and the previous divisor $b$ is the result.

\subsubsection*{Euclidean algorithm}
Suppose that it takes $N$ steps to use Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD. Denote $f_N$ as the $N_{th}$ number of Fibonacci series, and we can prove that $a \geq f_{N+2}$ and $b \geq f_{N+1}$ using mathematical induction. Since The $N_{th}$ Fibonacci number has the expression
$$f_N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}[(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^N - (\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^N] \approx \phi^N$$
where $\phi \approx 1.618$, then golden ratio. So we can get $N \approx \log_\phi(f_N)$Assume that $a>b$, then we can deduce that $f_{N+1} \approx b$, and get $N+1 \approx \log_\phi(b)$, and we finally get to the point that the time complexity of Euclidean algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(\log(\min(a, b)))$.
