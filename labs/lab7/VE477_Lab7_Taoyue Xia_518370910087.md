## 1. Random Search

### a. Implementation in OCaml

```ocaml
let rec random_search k array h length num = 
  if (Hashtbl.length h)  == length then
    (-1, num)
  else
    let i = Random.int length in 
    let elem = List.nth array i in 
    if elem == k then
      (i, num)
    else
      if Hashtbl.mem h i then
        random_search k array h length (num + 1)
      else
        begin
        Hashtbl.add h i true;
        random_search k array h length (num + 1)
        end
;;

let k = read_int();;
let sequence = read_line();;
let s = List.map int_of_string (Str.split (Str.regexp " ") sequence);;
let length = List.length s;;
let hash = Hashtbl.create length;;
Random.self_init ();;
let index, num = random_search k s hash length 1;;
if index == -1 then
  begin
  print_string "No such element in the array.\n";
  print_string "Total search time is: ";
  print_int num;
  print_string ".\n"
  end
else
  begin
  print_string "The index is ";
  print_int index;
  print_string ".\n";
  print_string "Total search time is: ";
  print_int num;
  print_string ".\n"
  end
```

It takes the manual input, and will return the index or `Not found`.

#### Sample output

```ocaml
(*Input*)
4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
(*Output*)
The index is 3.
Total search time is: 1.
```



### b. Determine average number of indices picked

Add the following three functions to help execute a loop of 100 times to get the average time. Also, the list will be generated randomly instead of manual input, with 1000 integers ranging from 0 to 1000.

```ocaml
let get_two (_, a) = a;;

let rec loop result list k h n = 
  if n == 100 then result
  else
    let tuple = random_search k list h (List.length list) 1 in 
    let num = get_two tuple in
    begin
      Hashtbl.clear h;
      loop (num :: result) list k h n
    end
;;

let rec generate_list result num = 
  if num == 1000 then result
  else
    let x = (Random.int 1000) in
    generate_list (x :: result) (num + 1)
;;
```



#### i. $k$ not in list

By running the code, we get the following outputs:

```ocaml
The average number of indices is: 7513.
The average number of indices is: 7540.
The average number of indices is: 7580.
```

So we can see that the average number of indices are about 7500 - 7600.



#### ii. one $k$ in list

Sample outputs:

```ocaml
The average number of indices is: 505.
The average number of indices is: 486.
The average number of indices is: 974.
The average number of indices is: 1004.
The average number of indices is: 325.
```

We can see that the average number of indices varies, but most of the times around 500.



#### iii. More than one $k$ in list

For two $k$ in list, the output is like

```ocaml
The average number of indices is: 465.
The average number of indices is: 248.
The average number of indices is: 507.
The average number of indices is: 252.
The average number of indices is: 491.
The average number of indices is: 328.
The average number of indices is: 496.
```

For three $k$ in list, the output is like:

```ocaml
The average number of indices is: 340.
The average number of indices is: 258.
The average number of indices is: 325.
The average number of indices is: 329.
The average number of indices is: 201.
The average number of indices is: 251.
The average number of indices is: 348.
The average number of indices is: 243.
```

From the above two  cases, we can find that, when the number of elements which equal to $k$ increases, the average number of indices decreases.

By approximation, if there exists $n$ elements which equal to $k$, the average number would be about $\frac{1000}{n + 2}$.



## 2. Linear Search

### a. Implementation in OCaml

```ocaml
let rec linear_search k array i = 
  match array with
  | [] -> -1
  | head :: tail ->
    if head == k then
      i
    else
      linear_search k tail (i+1)
;;

let k = read_int();;
let sequence = read_line();;
let s = List.map int_of_string (Str.split (Str.regexp " ") sequence);;
let length = List.length s;;
let index = linear_search k s 1;;
if index == -1 then
  print_string "No such element in the array.\n"
else
  begin
  print_string "The index is ";
  print_int index;
  print_string ".\n"
  end
```



#### Sample Output

```ocaml
(*Input*)
4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
(*Output*)
The index is 3.
Total search time is: 4.
```



### b. Average-case and Worst-case

Suppose that there are $n$ elements in the array.

#### i. No $k$ in list

* Average-case: $n$
* Worst-case: $n$



#### ii. One $k$ in list

* Average-case: $n/2$
* Worst-case: $n$



#### iii. More than 1 $k$ in list

Suppose there are $i$ elements that are equal to $k$.

* Average-case:

​	   If the first element equals to $k$, it will happen with probability
$$
\frac{\begin{pmatrix} n-1\\ i-1\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} n\\ i\end{pmatrix}}
$$
​	   If the second one is  the first to be detected as $k$, then it will happen with probability:
$$
\frac{\begin{pmatrix} n-2\\ i-1\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} n-1\\ i \end{pmatrix}}
$$
​	   Therefore, the average case can be expressed as:
$$
\begin{align}
avg &= \sum_{j=1}^{n-i} \frac{\begin{pmatrix} n-j\\ i-1\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} n-j+1\\ i\end{pmatrix}} \cdot j\\
	&= \sum_{j=1}^{n-i} \frac{i}{n-j+1}\cdot j\\
\end{align}
$$

* Worst-case: $n-i$.



## 3. Scramble Search

### a. Implementation in OCaml

```ocaml
let rec permutation list = 
  let rec select rest n = function
  | [] -> raise Not_found
  | head :: tail -> 
    if n == 0 then (head, rest @ tail)
    else select (head :: rest) (n - 1) tail
  in
  let rec select_rand l length = 
    select [] (Random.int length) l
  in
  let rec loop result length list = 
    if length == 0 then result
    else
      let elem, rest = select_rand list length in
      loop (elem :: result) (length - 1) rest
  in
  loop [] (List.length list) list
;;

let rec linear_search k array i = 
  match array with
  | [] -> -1
  | head :: tail ->
    if head == k then
      i
    else
      linear_search k tail (i+1)
;;


let k = read_int();;
let sequence = read_line();;
let l = List.map int_of_string (Str.split (Str.regexp " ") sequence);;
Random.self_init ();;
let perm = permutation l;;
List.iter (fun x -> print_int x; print_string" ") perm;;
let index = linear_search k perm 1;;
if index == -1 then print_string "No such element in the array.\n"
else
  begin
    print_string "The index is ";
    print_int index;
    print_string ".\n"
  end
```



#### Sample Output

```ocaml
(*Input*)
4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
(*Output*)
Permutation list: 9 10 5 3 1 8 2 7 6 4 
The index is 10.
```



### b. Average-case and Worst-case

Since the `ScrambleSearch` first permute the original array $A$ randomly into $A'$, and then use `LinearSearch` to get the result. The average-case and worst-case should be the same as `LinearSearch`, since randomness cannot be determined. Each permutation has equal probability to be performed.



#### i. No $k$ in array

* Average-case: $n$
* Worst-case: $n$



#### ii. One $k$ in array

* Average-case: $n/2$
* Worst-case: $n$



#### iii. More than 1 $k$ in array

* Average-case:

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{n-i} \frac{i}{n-j+1} \cdot j
$$

* Worst-case: $n$



## 4. Best Complexity

Since the `random` generator follows a uniform distribution, 

* In `RandomSearch`, each index is chosen with the same probability, so it takes more trials to get the final index.
* In `LinearSearch`, we just traverse the array to get the index, which is stable $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time complexity.
* In `ScrambleSearch`, we first create a permutation of the array, then perform `LinearSearch`. It can reduce some bad cases to good ones. 

Therefore, `ScrambleSearch` seems to be the best strategy.



## 5. Test for three algorithms

### i. Random Search

Code for test is shown below:

```ocaml
let rec random_search k array h length num = 
  if (Hashtbl.length h)  == length then
    (-1, num)
  else
    let i = Random.int length in 
    let elem = List.nth array i in 
    if elem == k then
      (i, num)
    else
      if Hashtbl.mem h i then
        random_search k array h length (num + 1)
      else
        begin
        Hashtbl.add h i true;
        random_search k array h length (num + 1)
        end
;;

let get_two (_, a) = a;;

let rec loop result list k h n = 
  if n == 1000 then result
  else
    let tuple = random_search k list h (List.length list) 1 in 
    let num = get_two tuple in
    begin
      Hashtbl.clear h;
      loop (num :: result) list k h (n + 1)
    end
;;

let rec generate_list result num = 
  if num == 10000 then result
  else
    let x = (Random.int 10000) in
    generate_list (x :: result) (num + 1)
;;


Random.self_init ();;
let k = Random.int 10000;;

let sequence = generate_list [] 0;;
let length = List.length sequence;;
let hash = Hashtbl.create length;;
let indices_list = loop [] sequence k hash 0;;
(* List.iter (fun x -> print_int x; print_string " ") indices_list;; *)
let avg = (List.fold_left (+) 0 indices_list) / 1000;;
print_string "The average number of indices is: ";;
print_int avg;;
print_string ".\n";;
```

Since for `RandomSearch`, it takes too many trials to get the index, we just test for the case of 1000 elements and 10000 elements.

For 1000 elements, we have the average:

```ocaml
The average number of indices is: 7497.
```

For 10000 elements, we have the average:

```ocaml
The average number of indices is: 97176.
```

Therefore, by approximation. If we want to test for 1000000 elements for 1000 times, the average would be about 7000000 to 10000000, which is about 10 times the size of the array.



### ii. Linear Search

Code for test is shown below:

```ocaml
let rec linear_search k array i = 
  match array with
  | [] -> 1000000
  | head :: tail ->
    if head == k then
      i
    else
      linear_search k tail (i+1)
;;


let rec generate_list result num = 
  if num == 1000000 then result
  else
    let x = (Random.int 1000000) in
    generate_list (x :: result) (num + 1)
;;

let rec loop result num k = 
  if num == 1000 then result
  else
    let s = generate_list [] 0 in 
    let i = linear_search k s 1 in 
    loop (i :: result) (num + 1) k
;;

Random.self_init ();;
let k = Random.int 1000000;;
let sequence = loop [] 0 k;;
let times = (List.fold_left (+) 0 sequence) / 1000;;
print_string "The number of search of 1000 times is: ";;
print_int times;;
print_string ".\n";;
```

Which generates an array with 1000000 elements randomly and run for 1000 times.

Finally, it gives the average seach times as:

```ocaml
The number of search of 1000 times is: 645338.
```



### iii. Scramble Search

Code for test is shown below:

```ocaml
let safe_map f xs =
  let rec helper acc = function
    | [] -> List.rev acc
    | x :: xs ->
       helper (f x :: acc) xs
  in
  helper [] xs
;;

let shuffle list =
  let ll = safe_map (fun c -> (Random.bits (), c)) list in
  let sorted = List.sort compare ll in
  safe_map snd sorted
;;

let rec linear_search k array i = 
  match array with
  | [] -> 1000000
  | head :: tail ->
    if head == k then
      i
    else
      linear_search k tail (i+1)
;;

(* let rec scramble_search k array i = 
  let s = permutation array in
  linear_search k s i
;; *)

let rec generate_list result num = 
  if num == 1000000 then result
  else
    let x = (Random.int 1000000) in
    generate_list (x :: result) (num + 1)
;;

let rec loop result num k = 
  if num == 1000 then result
  else
    let s = generate_list [] 0 in 
    let perm = shuffle s in 
    let i = linear_search k perm 1 in 
    loop (i :: result) (num + 1) k
;;

Random.self_init ();;
let k = Random.int 1000000;;
(* let sequence = generate_list [] 0;;
let s = shuffle sequence;;
List.iter (fun x -> print_int x; print_string " ") s;; *)

let indices = loop [] 0 k;;
let avg = (List.fold_left (+) 0 indices) / 1000;;
print_string "The number of search of 1000 times is: ";;
print_int avg;;
print_string ".\n";;
```

Which generates an array with 1000000 elements randomly and run for 1000 times.

Finally, it gives the average seach times as:

```ocaml
The number of search of 1000 times is: 628595.
```



### a. Performance

According to the above statistics, we can see that `ScrambleSearch` has the best performance according to the number of search times.

But it takes quite long to construct the permutation. If we consider time consumption, then `LinearSearch` would be better.



### b. Discussion

In item 4, I expect `ScrambleSearch` to be the best. 

From the real test carried out in the previous part, it is true that `ScrambleSearch` is the best in terms of the number of search times.

However, in terms of time consumption, `LinearSearch` would be the best, since it doesn't need to perform a permutation which takes $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time complexity.
