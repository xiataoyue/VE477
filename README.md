## About Honor Code

- If there are same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code.
- The owner of this repository should not take any commitment for other's faults.
- According to the student handbook (2021 version),

> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from others is considered plagiarism.



## About OCaml

From VE477 in 2021, it is encouraged to use `OCaml` to write the programs in labs and projects, which can win you a bonus. 

In some of the labs and projects, I have implemented the algorithms in `OCaml`. Although some of my implementations seems na√Øve and a little bit tedious, it could pass `JOJ` for all the cases. 

Also, if it can help those who is visiting my repository, feel free to have a look. Hope that it will guide you somehow into `OCaml`.
